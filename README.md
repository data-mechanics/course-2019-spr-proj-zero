# course-2019-spr-proj-zero

Practice project repository for the Spring 2019 iteration of the Data Mechanics course at Boston University.

Suppose that you have two team members `alice@bu.edu` and `bob@bu.edu` with the GitHub usernames `alicegh` and `bobgh`. To complete this project, fork this repository and add a single directory with a name of the form `alice_bob` (ascending alphabetical order and separated by an underscore); for a single member, the directory name would simply be `alice`. Add a single file `members.txt`  within this directory that contains the mappings from members' GitHub user names to their BU login names (one mapping per line).

For example, Alice and Bob would create a single file `./alice_bob/members.txt` with the following contents:
```
alicegh:alice
bobgh:bob
```

Below are some common issues to avoid.
* Do not delete project skeleton files (i.e., this README file).
* Do not forget to create a team folder.
* Make sure the usernames in the folder name are in ascending alphabetical order.
* Use the correct file name.
* Make sure there is no extra whitespace in the `members.txt` file.
